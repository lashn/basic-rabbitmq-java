Tried a basic producer and consumer application with rabbitmq
Used common connection handler across the project to effectively reuse methods
Utilized cloud instance of rabbitmq with https://www.cloudamqp.com/ for this project

For some one to get started cloud instances helps with instant access and ready to code in shortest time
Used Maven for Java client RabbitMQ dependencies
