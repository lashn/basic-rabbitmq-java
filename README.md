Tried a basic producer and consumer application with rabbitmq.
Used common connection handler across the project to effectively reuse methods.

Utilized cloud instance of rabbitmq with https://www.cloudamqp.com/ for this project. Used Maven for Java client RabbitMQ dependencies

For some one to get started cloud instances helps with instant access and ready to code in shortest time.
